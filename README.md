# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using various machine learning models. The dataset used for this project contains information about houses in the USA, including features such as income, house age, number of rooms and bedrooms, population, and price.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- XGBoost

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and can be found at the following link: USA Housing Dataset.

The dataset includes the following columns:

Avg. Area Income: The average income of residents in the area.
Avg. Area House Age: The average age of houses in the area.
Avg. Area Number of Rooms: The average number of rooms in houses in the area.
Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: The average number of bedrooms in houses in the area.
Area Population: The population of the area.
Price: The price of the property.
Running the Code
To run the code, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.
Download the dataset from the provided link and save it as "USA_Housing.csv" in the same directory as your code.
Open the code in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
Execute the code cell by cell to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and build and evaluate various machine learning models.
You will see the evaluation results for each model, including R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error.
Machine Learning Models
This project explores five machine learning models for house price prediction:

Linear Regression
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Lasso Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
